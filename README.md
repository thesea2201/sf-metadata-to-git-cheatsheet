# Salesforce metadate to git cheatsheet

## Context
   
I a new Salesforce developer. I started to work with the Salesforce project and using git I am a developer and join in new projects in Salesforce. I have a problem when coding with Salesforce is saving the latest code from Salesforce server. It's not a save operation, but I often miss metadata when committing git (maybe not a big problem if I have more experience + better memory ðŸ˜‚). So I decided to create this cheat sheet to help newcomers like me. Very welcome and appreciate your contributions.
